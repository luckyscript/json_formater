# json formater
We always have a headache when we want to make an Object to a json string;

Think this case:
when we want to copy our javascript object`{'a': 1}` to some mock platform, it always shows JSON error, because it's not a correct json.

so we use JSON.stringify and then copy? However, it always produce some escape and other token.

Use this package to solve the problem!just:
```
import formater from 'json-formater';
formater.format('{a: "b"}')
```

### boolean & null
boolean & null has literal value: true, false, null

Whitespace can be inserted between any pair of tokens. Excepting a few encoding details, that completely describes the language.
